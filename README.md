Public Data Platform
====================

This is the documentation repository for the Public Data Platform API. It is a separate effort from Qu, the software that powers this API. That documentation lives [here](http://cfpb.github.io/qu/).

Check out the [gh-pages view](https://github.cfpb.gov/pages/data-platform/public-data-platform.io/). 


Thanks to the eregs team and their documentation work for starting us off with a great codebase.
