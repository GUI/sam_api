### Overview

The SAM API is a RESTful method of retrieving public information about the businesses or individuals (referred to as "entities") within the SAM data set. The information can currently be retrieved on an entity-by-entity basis. The next public release of the API will include search capabilities. The pilot API is available through api.data.gov at [http://api.data.gov/sam/registrations](http://api.data.gov/sam/registrations), but that API does not have the complete set of data elements. The version of the API referred to here is in test.

##### Get started
If you find yourself overwhelmed, we organized this site into four major areas.

- [API basics](basics.html) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API calls](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations with an interactive console.
- [Query language](queries.html) contains a comprehensive listing of all the API's types, functions, and enumerations.
- [Field reference](fields.html) lists and describes the type of information reported in the LAR.
