<h3>Field reference for HMDA LAR data</h3>

<p>Lenders covered under HMDA are required to keep a Loan Application Register (LAR). Each time someone applies for a loan at a HMDA-covered institution, that lender is required to make a corresponding entry into the LAR. A LAR for a given calendar year contains a record of all applications that reached a final action in that year (regardless of what year it was submitted). The type of information reported in the LAR is listed in this table.</p>

<p>If you want to understand the finer details of the reporting process, visit our <a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/hmda/learn-more/">HMDA site</a> to learn more.<p>
